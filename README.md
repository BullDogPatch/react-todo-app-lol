# React Todo App

Isn't this what every front end developer should build. ðŸ˜ƒ  
This is just a proof of concept that after some time away I was still able to create a basic todo app.

Will have add functionallity, delete functionallity and hopefully an edit function.
Also todos will be stored in local storage.
